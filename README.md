# Design Patterns Examples

Welcome to the Design Patterns Examples repository! This project serves as a comprehensive guide to various design patterns implemented in different programming languages. Whether you're a novice looking to learn or an experienced developer seeking a quick reference, you'll find useful examples here.

This repository is open for contributions. If you have a design pattern implementation you'd like to share or an improvement to an existing one, feel free to submit a pull request.

## Introduction

Design patterns are proven solutions to recurring problems encountered in software design. They provide a structured approach to solving common design issues, making code more maintainable, flexible, and scalable. This repository aims to explore various design patterns with clear examples and explanations.

## Design Patterns

The following design patterns will be covered in this repository:

- **Creational Patterns**
  - [Singleton](Creational/DesignPatterns.Creational.Singleton/Usage.cs)
  - [Factory](Creational/DesignPatterns.Creational.Factory/Usage.cs)
  - [Abstract Factory](Creational/DesignPatterns.Creational.AbstractFactory/Usage.cs)
  - [Builder](Creational/DesignPatterns.Creational.Builder/Usage.cs)
  - [Prototype](Creational/DesignPatterns.Creational.Prototype/Usage.cs)

- **Structural Patterns**
  - [Adapter](structural/adapter/README.md)
  - [Bridge](structural/bridge/README.md)
  - [Composite](structural/composite/README.md)
  - [Decorator](structural/decorator/README.md)
  - [Facade](structural/facade/README.md)
  - [Flyweight](structural/flyweight/README.md)
  - [Proxy](structural/proxy/README.md)

- **Behavioral Patterns**
  - [Chain of Responsibility](behavioral/chain_of_responsibility/README.md)
  - [Command](behavioral/command/README.md)
  - [Interpreter](behavioral/interpreter/README.md)
  - [Iterator](behavioral/iterator/README.md)
  - [Mediator](behavioral/mediator/README.md)
  - [Memento](behavioral/memento/README.md)
  - [Observer](behavioral/observer/README.md)
  - [State](behavioral/state/README.md)
  - [Strategy](behavioral/strategy/README.md)
  - [Template Method](behavioral/template_method/README.md)
  - [Visitor](behavioral/visitor/README.md)

Each pattern has a code example in C# programming languages.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/YourFeature`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/YourFeature`).
5. Open a pull request.
